#
#     ssh me@server 'echo $PATH'
#
# This is the ONLY init file that would be executed by zsh. I have no
# choice but to assemble the PATH right here, so that all profiles from
# my Guix setup can be accessed properly.
#
# Yet, this file would be executed EVERYTIME a zsh is spawned, hence
# the __ZSH_ENV_INITIALIZED__ variable. To update the PATH, one needs
# to log out and then log back in, or unset this variable.
#
# If the PATH turned out wrong, check the zprofile files. Some systems
# source /etc/profile in ~/.zprofile or /etc/zprofile, and would unset
# the PATH we built here.
